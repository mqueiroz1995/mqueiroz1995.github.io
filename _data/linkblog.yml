    This section describes why I like being a software engineer better than I could.

    **The Joys of the Craft:**
    - The sheer joy of making things
    - The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people
    - The fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning
    - The joy of always learning
    - The delight of working in such a tractable medium.  The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.

    Interesting article and relates to what I've seen working in practice. 

    However, at some point engineers should start to dictate the direction as well. It shouldn't be about making your superiors happy, it should be about generating business value and engineering takes a big role in that. Your superiors won't have enough detail to prioritize a engineering roadmap. Engineers should fill that gap.

    This page previous title was "Recommended Stuff - Software Engineering edition". 

    It was sort of a link blog, but I didn't know this concept existed before reading Simon's post. 

    His approach is interesting because it enrichs the content with tags, comments. He is also a nice guy and tries to spotlight the author. 

    I stopped updating this page a long time ago, but I got inspired by his post to start doing it again, in a better way.
