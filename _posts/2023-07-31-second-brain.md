Once in a while I fall into the rabbit hole of trying to find content that I've seen in the past. This page tries to collect those golden nuggets somewhere I can easily recall afterward.

{% assign posts_by_year = site.data.linkblog | group_by_exp: "post", "post.date | date: '%Y'" | sort: "name" | reverse %}
{% for year in posts_by_year %}
### {{ year.name }}

{% assign sorted_posts = year.items | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
{% for post in sorted_posts %}
#### [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.link }})
<small>{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} </small>

{{ post.comment }}

{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
