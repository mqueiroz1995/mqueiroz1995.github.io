I love to solve problems. But not every kind of problem.

I'm drawn to open-ended problems—ones without clear-cut answers that demand creativity and welcome different approaches.

Yet, I'm not captivated by pure theoretical challenges.

To be honest, I'm pragmatic: I only get excited when solutions promise practical outcomes. While I respect academic research as a driver of societal breakthroughs[^1], academia itself doesn't ignite my passion.

One way to describe my approach is that I feel[^2] more like an engineer than a scientist.

Solutions to engineering problems are purpose-built approximations. They rarely generalize beyond their specific context, but they always deliver tangible results.

Interestingly, not every problem fitting this description is technical — designing a hiring process, for instance, fits this definition. Anyway, I'll continue to refer to this broad set of problems as engineering problems.

In my 10-year software engineering career, I've explored various technologies but devoted most of my time to Android development.

Looking back, my focused approach paid off. As you master technical details, you can shift attention to solve the underlying engineering problem. This enables managing increasing complexity and allowed me to become a leader who creates long-term solutions that empower dozens of engineers and affect millions of users.

But as problems grow in scale, Android apps become a small part — or no part — of the solution[^3]. The complete solution is usually a complex system with interconnected components.

Software engineering continues to excite me after a decade because it continues to offer a stream of engaging engineering problems. Yet, I no longer believe investing deeply in Android development is my optimal path forward. I (still) remain an Android engineer, but to drive more systemic impact, I will work to expand my knowledge boundaries beyond mobile.

[^1] In the 50s I would never have said that Von Neumann's architecture would be as useful as it is today. Also, in my college classes in 2015ish, I would never have said ML would be as useful and generalized as it is today.

[^2] Don't feel surprised if you see tending more to the side of science in the future.

[^3] Not every problem needs a mobile client. Those that need one might use alternatives to native Android development.
